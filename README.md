📊 Data Visualization Tasks: Week 3 Celebal Technologies 
This repo contains two separate files for Data Visualization in Python. 
I’ve worked on both Matplotlib and Seaborn separately to keep things clean and focused.

Files Included:

1. Data Visualization using Matplotlib
👉 All the classic plots—line, bar, scatter, histogram, pie—customized with labels, colors, legends.

2. Data Visualization using Seaborn
👉 Distribution plots, heatmaps, boxplots, pairplots.

⚙️Tools and Technologies Used: 
1. Python
2. Jupyter
3. Notebook
4. Matplotlib
5. Seaborn
6. Pandas
7. NumPy
